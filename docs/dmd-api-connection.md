**DMD API Connection checks for tokens from the API**

-If token is already available then it uses the token but if token is not available then it fetches new one.

-Next it gets the ping response, if ping is unauthorized then it fetches new token but if ping is authorized then it downloads DO Order Proposal Headers from DO API to PF new Linux server 172.17.0.19 with .sgh1 extension.
